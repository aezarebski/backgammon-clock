#+title: Backgammon timer

This is a simple Fischer style timer for backgammon. At the start of the match
each player is allocated 3 minutes and they get an extra 15 seconds to play each
move. To start player 1's timer press the "f" key, to start player 2's timer
press the "j" key.

* How to use?

Run the following command to start the server.

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# python2.7
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
#+end_src

Then point your browser at =http://localhost:8000/backgammon-clock.html=.

* Design

- Two keys, "f" and "j", are used to toggle the clock because otherwise you need
  an additional way to specify which player starts.
