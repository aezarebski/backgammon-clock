#+title: Backgammon timer

This is a simple Fischer style timer for backgammon. At the start of the match
each player is allocated 3 minutes and they get an extra 15 seconds to play each
move.

* How to use?

There is an example of this in action included in the repository. You just need
to run the following command to start the server.

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# python2.7
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
#+end_src

Then point your browser at =http://localhost:8000/index.html=. Alternatively,
you can include the relevant HTML and JS files in your project. You only need to
load the style sheet and the JS script and jQuery 3.5.1 and make sure you have a
=div= with the identifier =bgClock= to set this up.
