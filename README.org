#+title: Backgammon timer

This is a simple Fischer style timer for backgammon. At the start of the match
each player is allocated 3 minutes and they get an extra 15 seconds to play each
move. To start player 1's timer press the "f" key, to start player 2's timer
press the "j" key.

* How to use?

There is an example of this in action included in the repository. You just need
to run the following command to start the server.

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# python2.7
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
#+end_src

Then point your browser at =http://localhost:8000/backgammon-clock.html=.
Alternatively, you can include the relevant HTML and JS files in your project.
